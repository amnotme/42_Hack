I really enjoyed this project.  I had a blast working though it.  
The Vignere cipher has been my favorite by far. 

I felt like the content was extremely doable in a single weekend and that
it was very well thought out.  

The introductory problems are the right way to get the kids excited about 
cryptography.  I would also like to suggest that we can ask them to send us 
a message about how they're feeling in 42 that's been encoded so we can decode it
Perhaps we could take this as an opportunity to get some first-hand feedback 
on how they are feeling. 

Wingdings was a bit troublesome in getting.  I felt that I would be able to 
tamper with the unicode itself, add value to the hexadecimal part of the 
unicode string and then re use it to print it again.  Unfortunately ruby isn't
that cool for what I could tell and it took me a bit more time to figure this one
out than the rest.

The Vignere cipher was lots of fun to work around and creating the encrypter 
portion of it. 

I can suggest for the vignere cipher to create a bonus portion to it and 
to have the program encrypt or decrypt according to user's input

usage: ruby vignere.rb  [mode (1 for encrypt 2 for decrypt)] [key_string] [string]

All in all, a great project for the kiddos.
