  # Similar to the subsets problem, we observe that to get the permutations
  # of [1, 2, 3] we can look at the permutations of [1, 2] which are
  # [1, 2] and [2, 1] and add the last element to every possible index getting
  # [3, 1, 2], [1, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1]

  # pop off the last element
  first = array.shift
  # make the recursive call
  perms = permutations(array)
  # we will need an array to store all our different permutations
  total_permutations = []


  # Now we iterate over the result of our recusive call say [[1, 2], [2, 1]]
  # and for each permutation add first into every index. This new subarray
  # gets added to total_permutations.
